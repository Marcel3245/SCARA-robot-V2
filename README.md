This project features a 3D-printed robotic arm with four articulated joints, designed for precise and smooth movement. The arm consists of 40 lightweight parts modeled in Autodesk Fusion and includes custom electronics designed with KiCAD 8.0.

It is powered by a 12V DC system and driven by four Nema17 stepper motors with A4988 stepper drivers, all controlled by an Arduino Uno. A custom C# desktop application enables intuitive control and real-time debugging of the arm's movement.

**Key Features:**
- 4-axis articulated robotic arm
- 40 lightweight 3D-printed components
- Custom PCB design (KiCAD 8.0)
- Arduino Uno + A4988 stepper driver control
- Custom C# software for control & debugging

## The Results

The resulting robotic arm operates reliably with four articulated joints, each featuring carefully selected gear ratios to enhance movement control and precision. Smooth and accurate joint motion is achieved through the use of A4988 stepper drivers and custom Arduino-based control software. The fully assembled arm weighs approximately 7 kg and is capable of handling payloads up to 0.5 kg. It is equipped with limit switches that enable calibration and accurate position control, ensuring consistent and repeatable operation. The project was completed over a four-month development period, with a total hardware cost of â‚¬215, excluding the cost of 3D printing. Overall, the arm demonstrates robust mechanical design and dependable performance for a range of light-duty robotic tasks.
